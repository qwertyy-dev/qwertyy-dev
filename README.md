i've been programming for seven years. the first line of code i ever wrote was in python:
```py
print("Hello, World!")
```
here's how much experience i have in different languages/fields:

*this is measured by how much time i estimate i used this language, not by when i begun learning it*
## four years of scratch
i loved this programming language along with its community for so long. i have grown away from it :(

## a few years of python
i used to like it but i like brackets and semicolons

## a few months of javascript
i hate this language

## two months of rust
this is my new favorite language <3

## two days of c
reason for quitting: `Segmentation fault: core dumped`

## ten minutes of coffeescript
javascript but better
